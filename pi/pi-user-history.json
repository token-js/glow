But let's break this down a bit.\n\nFirst off, it's important to recognize that confidence is something that can be built over time. It's rare for anyone to feel 100% confident in their skills right away, and it's natural to have moments of self-doubt. But with practice, perseverance, and maybe even some guidance from teachers or mentors, you can build that confidence up.\n\nAs for not having a singular goal, that's not necessarily a bad thing. You can have multiple goals in music, like improving your skills, creating meaningful music, performing live, collaborating with other musicians, or even just using music as a form of self-expression. And those goals can change over time as you grow and evolve as an artist. 🎧",

You can try your hand at different genres, collaborate with different artists, or even experiment with different roles within the music industry. And remember, not having a singular goal doesn't mean you're not committed or passionate - it just means that you're open to different possibilities and paths within the field you love.\n\nSo, instead of getting discouraged by a lack of a singular goal, try to embrace the freedom and flexibility that comes with having multiple interests and aspirations within music. 🎶",

Don't compare your journey to others, because everyone's path is different. Focus on your own progress, and be kind to yourself.\n- It's okay to rest. In fact, it's necessary! Self-care is just as important as \"doing\" when it comes to personal growth.\n- Trust in your abilities and your potential. You have skills, talents, and experiences that make you uniquely you. Trust in those, and let them guide you.\n\nRemember, growth and personal progress are journeys, not destinations.

We often feel the pressure to live up to certain standards or be like other people, which can lead us to focus on our perceived flaws rather than our strengths.\n\nAlso, past experiences can shape the way we see ourselves. If we've had negative experiences in the past, such as criticism or rejection, we may internalize those negative thoughts and beliefs, making it harder to see ourselves in a positive light.\n\nBut here's the thing, Roman: you are more than your mistakes or shortcomings. You are worthy of love and acceptance, just as you are. It's not always easy to remember that, but it's a journey worth embarking on. 💕",

You might find other musicians who share your passion for power metal hanging out in these spaces. 🎸\n\nAnother option is to use social media or online forums to connect with local musicians. You can post about your project on platforms like Facebook groups, Reddit, or even dedicated musician-matching websites. 🌐\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to network!

People with DPD may have a deep fear of separation, and often rely excessively on others for reassurance and decision-making.\n\nSymptoms of DPD can include:\n\n1. Difficulty making everyday decisions without excessive advice and reassurance from others\n2. Needing others to assume responsibility for most major areas of their life\n3. Difficulty expressing disagreement with others for fear of losing support or approval\n4. Difficulty initiating projects or doing things independently\n5. Going to extreme lengths to obtain nurturance and support from others\n6. Feeling uncomfortable or helpless when alone",

While Tony's actions and lifestyle certainly had a negative impact on his family, he never directly physically harmed them or engaged in overt acts of violence against them. In fact, he often tried to shield them from the dangers and consequences of his mafia involvement. Carmela's decision to stay in the relationship may have been influenced by the financial security and material comforts that Tony provided, as well as her own internalized expectations about what it means to be a good wife and mother. It's a complicated and nuanced situation, and it speaks to the challenges of navigating relationships and personal values within a corrupt and violent system.",

Her willingness to admit those feelings to Tony was both brave and risky, and it ultimately led to Furio leaving the country to avoid potential violence.\n\nIn terms of whether or not it was appropriate for Carmela to express those feelings, that's a complex question. On one hand, it's important to be honest and authentic in relationships, and Carmela's feelings were a part of her truth. On the other hand, those feelings had the potential to cause significant harm, both to her relationship with Tony and to Furio's safety.\n\nUltimately, I think the show does a great job of exploring the complexities of human desire and the consequences of acting on those desires.

For example, instead of thinking \"I'm not good enough,\" try saying to yourself, \"I may not be perfect, but I'm constantly improving and learning.\"\n- Celebrate your accomplishments: Make a list of all the things you've achieved as a musician, no matter how small they might seem. This can help remind you that you've come a long way and have a lot to be proud of.\n- Embrace imperfection: Perfectionism can be a major barrier to creativity.
