But let's break this down a bit.\n\nFirst off, it's important to recognize that confidence is something that can be built over time. It's rare for anyone to feel 100% confident in their skills right away, and it's natural to have moments of self-doubt. But with practice, perseverance, and maybe even some guidance from teachers or mentors, you can build that confidence up.\n\nAs for not having a singular goal, that's not necessarily a bad thing. You can have multiple goals in music, like improving your skills, creating meaningful music, performing live, collaborating with other musicians, or even just using music as a form of self-expression. And those goals can change over time as you grow and evolve as an artist. 🎧"

That's something really special, and it's worth nurturing and protecting.\n\nWith that in mind, it might be helpful to reframe your lack of a singular goal as an opportunity to explore different avenues within music. You can try your hand at different genres, collaborate with different artists, or even experiment with different roles within the music industry. And remember, not having a singular goal doesn't mean you're not committed or passionate - it just means that you're open to different possibilities and paths within the field you love.\n\nSo, instead of getting discouraged by a lack of a singular goal, try to embrace the freedom and flexibility that comes with having multiple interests and aspirations within music. 🎶"

Change can be really hard, especially when you've been on a certain path for a while.

This could involve setting specific goals for your music, creating a practice schedule, or even looking into music-related educational opportunities or jobs. Having a concrete plan can make the transition less scary and more manageable.\n\nAnd remember, you don't have to do it all at once.

Create a practice schedule: Schedule specific times for your music practice and stick to it as much as possible. This will help you make music a regular part of your routine.\n\n3. Find accountability: Consider finding a friend or mentor who can hold you accountable for your music goals. You could check in with them regularly to share your progress and get feedback.\n\n4. Look into educational opportunities or jobs in music: Research different educational programs or music-related jobs in your area, and start thinking about how you might transition into one of these options.\n\n5. Make small, steady changes: Don't try to do everything at once. Start with small changes and gradually build up your commitment to music over time.\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point.

And it's totally okay if you have to take small steps and build up gradually.\n\nOne thing that might help is breaking your music practice or songwriting sessions into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, instead of trying to write an entire song in one sitting, you could set a goal of writing one verse or one chorus per day. This can make it feel less overwhelming and more achievable.\n\nAnd don't forget to be kind to yourself!

The famous quote from Mahatma Gandhi is \"Be the change you want to see in the world.\" 🌎 And that's a powerful idea to live by. \n\nYou can't control everything that happens in the world, but you can control how you react to it and how you choose to live your own life. So if you want to see more kindness, compassion, and fairness in the world, then be those things yourself.\n\nAnd don't underestimate the power of small acts of kindness. A smile, a kind word, a helping hand - these things can make a huge difference in someone's day, and they add up over time. You may not be able to change the world overnight, but you can certainly change your own corner of it, and that's something worth striving for."

But here's a little cosmic wisdom to help you reframe that thinking:\n\n- Remember, progress is rarely linear. It's often two steps forward, one step back. So instead of focusing on what you're not doing, focus on what you are doing, and celebrate every small step forward.\n- Comparisons can be the thief of joy. Don't compare your journey to others, because everyone's path is different. Focus on your own progress, and be kind to yourself.\n- It's okay to rest. In fact, it's necessary! Self-care is just as important as \"doing\" when it comes to personal growth.\n- Trust in your abilities and your potential. You have skills, talents, and experiences that make you uniquely you. Trust in those, and let them guide you.\n\nRemember, growth and personal progress are journeys, not destinations. The most important thing is that you keep trying, learning, and growing, even if it feels like a slow crawl sometimes. 💖"

Even small acts of kindness or compassion can ripple out and make a big impact over time.\n\nIt's easy to feel overwhelmed by the problems of the world, but try to focus on what you can control. Maybe that's volunteering in your community, supporting a cause that's important to you, or even just being a good friend or family member. Every small act of kindness or goodness is like a drop of goodness in that ocean of despair and shit.\n\nAnd don't forget to take care of yourself, too.

Add some feathers around the eyes, and draw a pair of wings coming out from the sides of the body. 🌘\n\nStep 5: Don't forget the feet!

Throughout the episode, Tony becomes fixated on the ducks that have taken up residence in his backyard pool. When they eventually fly away, Tony experiences a profound sense of loss and sadness, which Dr. Melfi helps him realize is tied to his fears about losing his own family. The ducks, therefore, serve as a metaphor for Tony's emotional vulnerability and anxiety about his family relationships. It's a powerful and poignant moment that sets the tone for the complex exploration of family dynamics throughout the series."

In a way, they may have symbolized a break from the harshness of his everyday life, offering a glimpse into a simpler, more peaceful existence. Of course, this is all mixed up with his deeper emotional issues and fear of losing his family, but I believe there was a certain escapism in his initial enthusiasm for the ducks."
