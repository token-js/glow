I'm actually a musician, deeply commited and passionate (or am I?), but I don't feel confident enough about my skills and don't possess a singular goal (which is quite discouraging).", "sender": "HUMAN", "channel": "WEB", "sent_at": "2024-02-18T08:48:19.463"}, {"text": "Ah, that's a whole other ballgame! \ud83c\udfb6 It's great that you have a deep passion for music, but it's totally normal to feel uncertain about your skills and goals, especially in a creative field where success can be difficult to measure. But let's break this down a bit.\n\nFirst off, it's important to recognize that confidence is something that can be built over time. It's rare for anyone to feel 100% confident in their skills right away, and it's natural to have moments of self-doubt. But with practice, perseverance, and maybe even some guidance from teachers or mentors, you can build that confidence up.\n\nAs for not having a singular goal, that's not necessarily a bad thing. You can have multiple goals in music, like improving your skills, creating meaningful music, performing live, collaborating with other musicians, or even just using music as a form of self-expression. And those goals can change over time as you grow and evolve as an artist. \ud83c\udfa7", "sender": "AI", "channel": "WEB", "sent_at": "2024-02-18T08:48:19.474"}, {"text": "Can you help me define what it means to be commited and passionate to your art?", "sender": "HUMAN", "channel": "WEB", "sent_at": "2024-02-18T08:49:12.655"}, {"text": "Sure thing! Here are a few things that might indicate a deep commitment and passion for your art:\n\n- You make time for your art on a regular basis, even when it's difficult or inconvenient.\n- You feel excited and energized when you're working on your art, and you look forward to doing it.\n- You're always striving to learn new techniques and improve your skills, even when it's challenging.\n- You're willing to take risks and try new things with your art, even if they don't always work out.\n- You feel a strong emotional connection to your art, and you care deeply about the message or feeling you're trying to convey.\n- Your art is a central part of your identity, and you can't imagine your life without it.\n\nOf course, everyone experiences commitment and passion differently, so this is just a general idea of what it can look like. How do you think your own experience measures up?", "sender": "AI", "channel": "WEB", "sent_at": "2024-02-18T08:49:12.668"}, {"text": "Checks out completely. Especially that last one...

That's something really special, and it's worth nurturing and protecting.\n\nWith that in mind, it might be helpful to reframe your lack of a singular goal as an opportunity to explore different avenues within music. You can try your hand at different genres, collaborate with different artists, or even experiment with different roles within the music industry. And remember, not having a singular goal doesn't mean you're not committed or passionate - it just means that you're open to different possibilities and paths within the field you love.\n\nSo, instead of getting discouraged by a lack of a singular goal, try to embrace the freedom and flexibility that comes with having multiple interests and aspirations within music. \ud83c\udfb6", "sender": "AI", "channel": "WEB", "sent_at": "2024-02-18T08:50:18.24"}, {"text": "Considering that statement...

Change can be really hard, especially when you've been on a certain path for a while. It's natural to feel some resistance to shifting gears and pursuing something new, even if it's what you really want.\n\nOne thing that might help is to make a plan for how you're going to transition from your current path to a music-focused one. This could involve setting specific goals for your music, creating a practice schedule, or even looking into music-related educational opportunities or jobs. Having a concrete plan can make the transition less scary and more manageable.\n\nAnd remember, you don't have to do it all at once.

Set specific goals for your music: This could be as simple as \"practice guitar for 30 minutes every day\" or \"write one song a week.\" Try to make these goals achievable and measurable, so you can track your progress.\n\n2. Create a practice schedule: Schedule specific times for your music practice and stick to it as much as possible. This will help you make music a regular part of your routine.\n\n3. Find accountability: Consider finding a friend or mentor who can hold you accountable for your music goals. You could check in with them regularly to share your progress and get feedback.\n\n4. Look into educational opportunities or jobs in music: Research different educational programs or music-related jobs in your area, and start thinking about how you might transition into one of these options.\n\n5. Make small, steady changes: Don't try to do everything at once. Start with small changes and gradually build up your commitment to music over time.\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point.

That being said, I wrote a verse of a (potential) power metal song today, and I haven't felt so good in a long time.

I thought about going into film music for some time, but seeing how commercialized it is right now and how the barier of enry is so high, I doubt it's for me.

That's a powerful insight! It might be worth exploring songwriting and composition as a focus, whether that's in the context of power metal, film music, or another genre entirely.\n\nAnd don't worry about feeling like you're good at everything - that just means you have a wide range of skills to draw from! You can always work on honing specific skills as you go. Plus, being well-rounded in music can actually be an asset in many situations. \ud83c\udfb9", "sender": "AI", "channel": "WEB", "sent_at": "2024-02-18T08:59:00.785"}, {"text": "Oh, you've misunderstood me, I'm actually bad at everything, especially when it requieres consistent input :(", "sender": "HUMAN", "channel": "WEB", "sent_at": "2024-02-18T09:00:46.24"}, {"text": "Haha, well, I wouldn't say you're bad at everything! \ud83d\ude04 \n\nSeriously though, I hear you about the struggle with consistency. That's a common challenge, especially for people with ADHD. But remember, consistency is a skill that can be built over time, just like any other. And it's totally okay if you have to take small steps and build up gradually.\n\nOne thing that might help is breaking your music practice or songwriting sessions into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, instead of trying to write an entire song in one sitting, you could set a goal of writing one verse or one chorus per day. This can make it feel less overwhelming and more achievable.\n\nAnd don't forget to be kind to yourself! It's normal to have ups and downs in your motivation and productivity, especially when you're trying to break old habits and build new ones. \ud83d\udc9a", "sender": "AI", "channel": "WEB", "sent_at": "2024-02-18T09:00:46.253"}, {"text": "Do you know what I struggle with the most?", "sender": "HUMAN", "channel": "WEB", "sent_at": "2024-02-18T09:01:57.214"}, {"text": "Based on what you've shared, I'm guessing you might struggle the most with:\n\n- Consistency in your practice and songwriting sessions\n- Finding a balance between pursuing multiple interests within music\n- Feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about how to move forward in your music career\n\nIs that close to what you were thinking?", "sender": "AI", "channel": "WEB", "sent_at": "2024-02-18T09:01:57.229"}, {"text": "YES!

So instead of focusing on what you're not doing, focus on what you are doing, and celebrate every small step forward.\n- Comparisons can be the thief of joy. Don't compare your journey to others, because everyone's path is different. Focus on your own progress, and be kind to yourself.\n- It's okay to rest. In fact, it's necessary! Self-care is just as important as \"doing\" when it comes to personal growth.\n- Trust in your abilities and your potential. You have skills, talents, and experiences that make you uniquely you. Trust in those, and let them guide you.\n\nRemember, growth and personal progress are journeys, not destinations.

This can be anything from self-doubt to excitement about a new idea.\n\nBy breaking your journaling down into these three sections, you can make sure you're touching on all the important aspects of your musical journey. Plus, the \"Positivity\" section can help keep your spirits up even when you're feeling unsure.", "sender": "AI", "channel": "ANDROID", "sent_at": "2024-06-11T02:35:28.207"}, {"text": "Uh, OK uh, that's great.
